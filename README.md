## Course management 
In this project we focus on solving an issue for a course platform which needs to maintain the information for courses, students and registrations. 

We'll have 3 layers (model, service and repository). In the model, we'll have POJOs, the repository will have the interfaces and its implementations for the persistence of the information and the service will have all the logic.
